# Facepunch Droid
The all amazing app for the best forum Facepunch.

Use Facepunch with a more mobile friendly design, and features.

If you don't trust me, you are more than welcome to build the app yourself.

# UPDATE AGAIN
Facepunch have now migrated over to the new forum, which completely breaks the app.
I am currently working on making the app as compatible as possible with the new forum, but don't expect miracles.

I've seem to get the new login working with the app now, but there is a lot of styling to be done, before I can release a new version.

I can't give any estimations, as I most likely will break them, as my spare time is very limited at the moment.

Hopefully when the new API is live, I can make a better app, but only time will tell.

Feel free to throw some donations via the app, to show your interest in the making of a new app. (It's in the drawer at the bottom)

## UPDATE
I'm currently working on a new app for the new facepunch forum, in React Native.
I've got login to work without issues, so now, I actually only need to implement:

## Making custom stylesheets for Facepunch Droid
It works the usual way CSS works.

## Q&A
**Q:** You're probably wondering, how is this app going to survive more than the other versions?

**A:** My app doesn't rely on an API, it simply injects some styling to the website, to make it more mobile friendly, and do other stuff more natively. So as long Facepunch is up, my app will continue to work, unless they start to change the HTML to much (This is easily fixed though)

---------

**Q:** WTF?!?! WHY HAVEN'T YOU FIXED THIS/WHY HASN'T THERE BEEN AN UPDATE IN A WHILE

**A:** Please note, I can only work on the app in my spare time, which is already pretty limited. I can usually work on the app from/to work, or if I'm lucky a little bit when I'm home, I have a wife that would like to see me too. I also work for free, and purely from interest.

---------

**Q:** What if Google Play pulls the app?

**A:** No problem, I will simply host it myself, and make a built-in updater (Which isn't allowed on Google Play ATM)
